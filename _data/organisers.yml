    is a research scientist in the
    Responsible and inclusive technologies group of IBM Research laboratory in
    Brazil. Her work focuses on human and social aspects of Artificial
    Intelligence systems, particularly conversational user interfaces. Her work
    in this area includes the development and application of mixed-methods
    research in the context of conversational systems. Currently, Heloisa is
    leading a project that aims to bring "conscious" access to micro-credit by
    enhancing non-traditional financial practices of low-income small business
    owners with AI technology in the Global South. Her research resulted in
    several publications in leading conferences (CHI, CUI, CSCW, DRS) and
    recognition in the HCI and Design field.

    has designed and evaluated systems that improve humans' access to and
    interaction with information-rich media and technologies through natural
    language. Cosmin has organized speech interaction workshops and panels at
    SIGCHI conferences such CHI, MobileHCI, and IUI for almost a decade, and has
    frequently delivered courses on designing voice interactions at these
    venues.
