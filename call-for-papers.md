In what ways can we advance our research on conversational user interfaces (CUIs) by including considerations on inclusivity and equity? As CUIs, like Google Home or chatbots, become an increasingly popular and commercially viable way of interacting with digital devices, investigation into the practice and design of more inclusive speech interactions are all the more essential. Authors across all disciplines are invited to submit position papers to the CHI 2023 workshop on the Inclusive Design of CUIs Across Modalities and Mobilities. We expect that the workshop will encourage contributions and discussions from participants, regardless of whether or not they consider themselves to be “experts” on these topics or the user populations in question. Papers can address the state of CUIs and their design for marginalized and vulnerable populations, ways to practice inclusive design of CUIs, and how we can move forward in the inclusive design of CUIs. Potential submissions can look at other areas that are related, such as how to address diverse groups of users that are potentially vulnerable or under-served, e.g., due to socio-economic status or disability.

## Submission Information 

We seek position papers that are 3 to 4 pages long (including references), submitted in the [CHI Extended Abstract format](https://chi2020.acm.org/authors/chi-proceedings-format/#EAF}{https://chi2020.acm.org/authors/chi-proceedings-format/#EAF), and describe work of discussion related to the position paper inclusive design topics outlined above. Admittance to the workshop will be based on the overall quality, novelty, and relevance of the submission, and the CUI community’s goals of bringing together a set of participants that can represent the diverse and multidisciplinary facets required for the design of CUIs. We will pay particular attention to under-served regions or universities, for our inclusive community will benefit from this, especially concerning the inclusive design of CUIs. Papers should be submitted to [Jaisie Sin](mailto:js.sin@mail.utoronto.ca) by **February 23rd, 2023**. At least one author of each accepted paper must attend the workshop. All participants must register for both the workshop and for at least one day of the conference.

## Publication

Accepted papers will be posted to the workshop website ahead of the workshop date and serve as the basis for presentations and discussion at the workshop. For examples of papers that are acceptable for the workshop, please see the websites for past CHI workshops in [2022](www.conversationaluserinterfaces.org/workshops/CHI2022/) and [2021](www.conversationaluserinterfaces.org/workshops/CHI2021/). All accepted workshop papers will also be invited to submit to the CUI ’23 conference taking place in Eindhoven, The Netherlands.
